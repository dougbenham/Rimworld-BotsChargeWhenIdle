# Bots Charge When Idle Rimworld Mod

Prevents friendly mechanoids from wandering around when idle - they instead go to any available charging stations or go dormant (mod respects max charge levels from mech groups)

Also adds a constant interrupt check while bots charge via these methods to do available work rather than just charging to full every time

Only applies to bots set to "work" order from their mech group, escort bots and bots already set to charge or dormancy will be unaffected.

Also does not appy to militors as their wandering seems more thematically appropriate.

I've only got the basic bots unlocked on my save so far, let me know if advanced bots break anything or need additional rules to feel good.
